# 3D Infinite Runner Game using OpenGL and C++
I developed Animal Surfers, a 3D infinite runner game using OpenGL and C++, featuring two distinct levels with increasing difficulty. The player controls an animal character (Cat in Level 1, Duck in Level 2), navigating through the environment to collect items, avoid obstacles, and reach the goal (Key in Level 1, Trophy in Level 2) before time runs out.
The game included two different camera perspectives (first-person and third-person), switchable via mouse input. The player could jump or switch lanes using the keyboard, and collision detection ensured interactions with collectibles (Birds and Fish), obstacles (Plants and Lily Pads), and targets (Key and Trophy). Upon collecting a collectible, the score increased, and upon hitting an obstacle, a game-over screen appeared with sound effects. The game ended with a win screen upon successfully reaching the goal.
I implemented animations for objects, including light intensity changes simulating day and night, and moving light sources following the player. Additionally, I integrated sound effects for key interactions, such as collecting items, hitting obstacles, and game state transitions. This project enhanced my skills in 3D game development, animation, collision detection, lighting, and interactive gameplay mechanics.
